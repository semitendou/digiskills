# 🌐 Digital Skills for All

**Digital Skills for All** is a youth-led initiative that helps people of all ages — especially younger students and seniors — learn how to use technology safely, confidently, and responsibly.  
Founded by Summer Chen, the project aims to make digital literacy accessible to everyone, one step at a time.

## 🧭 Mission

To empower individuals with the knowledge and confidence to navigate the online world safely — from spotting scams and fake news to protecting personal privacy and developing basic digital skills.

We believe **digital literacy is a human right**, and that safe, informed internet use should be accessible to everyone, regardless of age or background.
